        <h1>Problem</h1>
        <p>Everyday millions of students have to travel to school everyday. Some have to travel for hours while some only minutes. Some students may have an illness that may make it problamatic for the student to catch up with the curriculum and would naturally fall behind. The problem in this is that the students may experience alot of problems that may accure because of different reasons and as a result they fall behind in the curriculum and do bad. In a third world country students may have many problems compared to us in Norway when it comes to attending school. They might not have the transportation opportunities, wheather may change drastically and may lead to students not attending school. This is one of a thousand reasons that may occur.</p>

    </div>

    <div class="What-we-do2">
        <h1>Solution</h1>
        <p>Our solution to this problem is that we want to give out small digital watches out to the third world nations. These watches are small pieces of technology with a digital screen and a plastic strap. On this screen the students may track how long they have been studying, homework they have been assigned while you havenÂ´t had the opportunity to be present at a spesific class and attend online lectures. This solves many problems that epsecially the third world country students may experience. With this watch they can follow the lectures and not fall behind. The digital watch has a sensor it it also has the capability to review the users heartbeat and daily actitvities </p>
